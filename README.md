# Exordium (Website)

*Developed by the Exordium Development Team*

The Exordium website was originally being constructed using WordPress themes and plugins. However, after spending a lot of time reading their documentation and beginning to create our own custom elements we realised it would probably require too much work to mold WordPress into what we needed. We've now decided to move towards creating a website in `node` and `angular`. Something that is new to our developers.

The [theme](https://github.com/tvOdyssey/exordium-wp-theme) and [plugins](https://github.com/tvOdyssey/exordium-wp-core) we were developing are open-source, you're free to look at those archived repositories. 

## Prelude

Exordium is a virtual private networking software in the works. **Our goal is to donate all profits made from the VPN towards environmental protection, and to fight against the climate crisis.**

We hope to share as much of our programming as open source code to help others create their own projects and further the development of software built with electronjs and nodejs, which are the fundamental pieces to us.
